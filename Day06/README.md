## 📅 **Day 6 – Build Array from Permutation**  
🔗 **LeetCode Problem**: [1920. Build Array from Permutation](https://leetcode.com/problems/build-array-from-permutation)  
💡 **Difficulty**: Easy  
🧠 **Topic Tags**: Array, Simulation  

---

## ✍️ **Problem Summary**  
Given a zero-based permutation array `nums`, return a new array `ans` such that:  
`ans[i] = nums[nums[i]]` for every `0 <= i < nums.length`.  
A zero-based permutation means the array contains all integers from `0` to `nums.length - 1` exactly once.

---

## 🚧 **My Approach**  
- Initialized a new array `ans` of the same length.
- Iterated through the array and assigned `ans[i] = nums[nums[i]]`.

---

## 😖 **Struggles**  
- No major struggles since the problem was direct in its requirement.

---

## ✅ **What I Learned**  
- Practiced basic array manipulation and indexing.
- Reinforced understanding of permutation-based transformations.
